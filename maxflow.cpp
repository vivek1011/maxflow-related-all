http://www.spoj.com/problems/POTHOLE/ - Ford Fulkerson algorithm implementation basic - O(Maxflow * Edges);

A bipartite graph is graph which can be divided into two disjoint sets such that A intersection B = phi . and no cycles of odd length
are there in a graph. and edges are  there only between the two sets .and not within the same set. 
Check if a graph is bipartite- ? It has no odd cyles. , Coloring is possible with only 2 colours. 

Matching .is a subset of number of edges so taken so that number of edges that are incident or start from any vertex is 
not greater than one.
